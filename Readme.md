# WinForms Reporting - Create a Report from the DevExpress GridControl 

This example demonstrates two techniques (methods) that allow you to do the following:

* Create a grid-based report in code.
* Preview the report at runtime.
* Load the report in the Report Designer.

## Ribbon UI

The Ribbon UI includes the following options:

* **DataTable Conversion** - Demonstrates how to use the intermediate DataTable.
* **Report Generator Conversion** - Uses the `ReportGenerator` class from the Reporting Extensions library that ships as part of the DevExpress installation. 


## DataTable Method

The [GridView.GetVisibleRowHandle](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Grid.GridView.GetVisibleRowHandle(System.Int32)) method is used to obtain visible data rows. A [DataTable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.datatable) is created and passed to the report constructor in the code-behind file. The report constructor uses the `GridView` to create a report layout at runtime. The [XRTable](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XRTable) structure is composed of grid column captions. Grouped columns generate the [GroupHeaderBand](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.GroupHeaderBand) in the report.

## ReportGenerator Method

The [ReportGenerator.GenerateReport](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.ReportGeneration.ReportGenerator.GenerateReport.overloads) method creates a report from the [GridView](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Grid.GridView) and allows you to specify the 
[report generation options](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.XtraReports.ReportGeneration.ReportGenerationOptions._members).
