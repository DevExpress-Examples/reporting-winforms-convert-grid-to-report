# How to convert an XtraGrid to an XtraReport at runtime

<b>NOTE:</b> Use the <b><a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.ReportGeneration.ReportGenerator">Report Generator</a></b> tool to convert a <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraGrid.GridControl">Grid Control</a> to a <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XtraReport">Report</a> with one line of code. See: <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/114962/controls-and-libraries/data-grid/export-and-printing/advanced-grid-printing-and-exporting">Advanced Grid Printing and Exporting</a>.


<i>Applies to older versions:</i>
<p>This example demonstrates how to dynamically create a report based upon the GridControl at runtime.  This means that all filtering and sorting conditions selected in the grid are also applied in a report. To accomplish this task, it is necessary to create a report with all the necessary bands, bind it to a data source and adjust all the necessary options.</p>
